# Ukulele Website
This is a website about the ukulele, a popular Hawaiian musical instrument. The website contains a brief history of the ukulele, an introduction to the sounds of the ukulele and a booking facility where users can book online ukulele classes. The site content helps beginners to learn more about the ukulele and allows site owners to showcase interesting information about the instrument and encourage users to take their online classes.

## UX <br><br>
### Who is this website for?

### Wireframes
The original wireframes for this project are located in the 'wireframe' folder:
* Desktop layout (wireframe/ukulele.pdf)
* Mobile layout (wireframe/mobile-wireframe.pdf)
<br><br>

## Features

### Existing Features
**Navbar** - There are two version of the navbar (one for desktop and one for mobile) that were created using Bootstrap. The consist navigation panel on each page allows users to navigate easily through the site. 

**CTA Links** - There are buttons at the end of the 'About', 'Home' and 'Play' pages that encourage users to quickly navigate to other pages on the site that they are likely to wish to visit once they've scrolled through the current page.

**Booking Form** - There is a booking form on the 'Booking' page that allows users to input their name and email address and to book a class - this is currently static. 

**Musical Ukulele** - The 'Play' page has a basic table with audio embedded that the user can click to hear individual notes.
<br><br>

## Features Left to Implement
**Booking Form** - I'd like to build on the booking form so that the user instantly receives confirmation of their booking on screen, as well as an automated email to say they've signed up. I'd also like to extend the calendar view so that users can page through it to the following weeks and book classes well in advance if they wish.

**Live Class Page**  - I'd like to add a page where the online classes are shown when the teacher goes live. Students could log in to this page and access their classes and schedule easily. The teacher could also opt to store class videos and tutorials here for revision.

**Interactive Musical Ukulele** - I'd like to add more features to the 'Play' page so that users could 'play' the ukulele more easily and have more choice of notes. This section could also display demos and have a searchable songbook.
